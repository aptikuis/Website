<h2>Places to eat near the university</h2>

<p>
The following areas are recommended for a place to eat.
</p> <p>
<b>Very close to the university.</b>
There are some sporadic restaurants, coffee shops, and bars very near the university, including:<br/>
• Father & Sons bar (at King Edward and Osgoode)<br/>
• No Forks Given burgers (at King Edward and Somerset)<br/>
• 3 Brothers Shawarma and Poutine (at Osgoode and Henderson)<br/>
• Second Cup coffee shop (on Laurier near Cumberland)<br/>
• Happy Goat coffee shop (at Wilbrod and Friel)<br/>
</p> <p>

<b>Byward Market.</b>
This is slightly north of the university, about a 15 minute walk. There are many restaurants, bars, and shops. This area is fairly touristy.
</p> <p>

<b>Elgin Street.</b>
This is slightly west of the university, and very close to the Business Inn. It has many nice restaurants, bars, and boutiques.
</p> <p>

<b>Rideau Centre.</b>
This is a mall very close to the university, about a 10-minute walk if you use the Mackenzie King bridge. It has a food court.
</p> 

<h2>Things to do in Ottawa</h2>

<p>
Ottawa is a lovely city and there's a variety of things to explore during your free time, such as Wednesday afternoon.
</p><p>

<b>Museums.</b>
Here are some of the museums that are within range of the university.<br/>
• The National Gallery of Canada (25 minute walk, near the Byward Market)<br/>
• Canadian Museum of Nature (25 minute walk, near Elgin Street)<br/>
• Canadian Museum of History (a very nice 40 minute walk, across the river in Gatineau)<br/>
• Ottawa Art Gallery (5 minute walk, near the Rideau centre, free)<br/>
• Canadian War Museum (near Pimisi station, or a 50-minute walk)
</p><p>

<b>Walking around.</b>
The Parliament Buildings are traditionally a sightseeing draw, but unfortunately they are currently under major renovations.
It is nice to walk along the Rideau Canal, by the locks, and along the Ottawa river.
</p><p>

<b>Bike rental.</b>
Ottawa has nice trails for biking around. Bikes can be rented for $11/hour from <a href="http://www.rentabike.ca/about-us/">RentABike</a>, at a site nearby to the university.
</p><p>

<b>Gatineau park.</b>
Nearby Gatineau Park is a treasure of the National Capital Region, with lovely hiking trails and more.
It is a 50-minute bus-ride, taking the STO route 31 or 33 from the Rideau Centre bus stop.
</p><p>

<b>Beaver tails.</b>
My daughter recommends that you try a beaver tail (sweet fried dough) in the Byward Market.
