<p><b>Shirly Geffen</b> (KU Leuven) - <a onclick="toggle_visibility('b2');">Dynamical comparison of amenable actions by non-amenable groups<img id="b2button" src="images/down.png" width="15px"></a></p><div class="abstract" id="b2"><p>We pull back paradoxical dynamical systems (e.g. hyperbolic groups acting on their Gromov boundary), to paradoxical decompositions of the acting group itself. This allows us to show that whenever such groups admit a minimal amenable topologically free action on a compact Hausdorff space, the system has dynamical comparison and the attached crossed product is a purely infinite classifiable C*-algebra.<br/> This is joint work with Eusebio Gardella, Julian Kranz, and Petr Naryshkin.</p></div>
<p><b>Michael Hartz</b> (Saarland University) - <a onclick="toggle_visibility('b3');">TBA</a></p>
<p><b>Mehrdad Kalantar</b> (University of Houston) - <a onclick="toggle_visibility('b4');">On invariant subalgebras of group C* and von Neumann algebras<img id="b4button" src="images/down.png" width="15px"></a></p><div class="abstract" id="b4"><p>Given an irreducible lattice  Γ in the product of higher rank simple Lie groups, we prove: (i) every  Γ-invariant von Neumann subalgebra of L(Γ) is generated by a normal subgroup; and (ii) given a non-amenable unitary representation π of  Γ, every  Γ-equivariant conditional expectation on C<sup>*</sup><sub>π</sub>(Γ) is the canonical conditional expectation onto the C*-subalgebra generated by a normal subgroup. This is joint work with Nikolaos Panagopoulos.</p></div>

<p><b>Ian Putnam</b> (University of Victoria) - <a onclick="toggle_visibility('b9');">A new construction of expansive/hyperbolic dynamics and their C*-algebras<img id="b9button" src="images/down.png" width="15px"></a></p><div class="abstract" id="b9"><p>A standard tool in the study of hyperbolic dynamical systems is the notion of a Markov partition, which allows a complicated topological system to be coded by combinatorial one. The simplest example of this is decimal (or binary) expansion of real numbers. In this talk, I will show how the process can be 'reverse engineered': starting from a shift of finite type and the idea of binary expansion, one can produce interesting hyperbolic systems. I will also discuss the implications for operator algebras associated with such systems. No prior knowledge of  dynamics will be necessary.</p></div>

<p><b>Stefaan Vaes</b> (KU Leuven) - <a onclick="toggle_visibility('b14');">Nonsingular Bernoulli actions: a survey<img id="b14button" src="images/down.png" width="15px"></a></p><div class="abstract" id="b14"><p>Given a countable group G and a base space X, the Bernoulli action is the translation action of G on the product space X<sup>G</sup>, equipped with a product of probability measures μ<sub>g</sub> on X. I will present a survey of recent results on the ergodicity and Krieger type of such nonsingular Bernoulli actions. I will in particular present a joint work with Tey Berendschot providing a complete answer when G=Z is the group of integers. It turns out that most, but not all injective factors can be written as the crossed product by a nonsingular Bernoulli action of Z, since we prove that the associated Krieger flow must satisfy a divisibility property.</p></div>
<p><b>Maria Grazia Viola</b> (Lakehead University) - <a onclick="toggle_visibility('b15');">Cuntz-Pimsner algebras associated to vector bundles twisted by minimal homeomorphisms<img id="b15button" src="images/down.png" width="15px"></a></p><div class="abstract" id="b15"><p>Cuntz-Pimsner algebras were introduced by Pimsner in the '90s, as generalization of both Cuntz-Krieger algebras and crossed products by the integers. The underlying mathematical object behind Pimsner's construction is a C*-correspondence over a C*-algebra.  Of particular interest are Cuntz-Pimsner algebras arising from full, minimal, non-periodic, and finitely generated projective C*-correspondence over commutative C*-algebras. A large class of such examples is obtained by considering the set Γ(V,α) of continuous sections of a complex vector bundle V on a compact metric space X, where left multiplication is given by a twist by a homeomorphism α:X→X. The talk will focus on the structural properties and classification of Cuntz-Pimsner algebras associated with this class of C*-correspondences, in the case when α is a minimal homeomorphism.<br/>In the case of crossed products by minimal homeomorphisms, the orbit-breaking subalgebra, defined by I. Putnam, is a large subalgebra in the sense of N. C. Phillips. Orbit-breaking subalgebras can also be defined in the context of Cunts-Pimsner algebras associated to correspondences of the form  Γ(V,α).  We show that when V is a line bundle, the orbit-breaking subalgebra is a centrally large subalgebra. Moreover, when X has finite covering dimension, the orbit-breaking subalgebra is classifiable. This is joint work with M. S. Adamo, D. Archey, M. Georgescu, M. Forough, J. A Jeong, and K. Strung.</p></div>

I will explain a method for finding groupoid models for such C*-algebras, and then present results characterizing certain properties of these groupoids in terms of the initial algebraic semigroup action. As an application, we obtain structural results for the C*-algebras arising from several large classes of algebraic semigroup actions. This is joint work with Xin Li (University of Glasgow).</p></div>
<p><b>Andrew Dean</b> (Lakehead University) - <a onclick="toggle_visibility('a5');">Structure and classification of real C*-algebras<img id="a5button" src="images/down.png" width="15px"></a></p><div class="abstract" id="a5"><p> The program to classify certain simple C*-algebras has now reached a very advanced state, for complex C*-algebras. The situation for real C*-algebras is much less clear. We will give a survey of structure and classification results for real C*-algebras.</p></div>

Then I will review recent work by Toms where he constructed homotopies of positive elements with constant Cuntz class for C*-algebras which are unital, separable, exact, approximately divisible and of real rank zero. Building on Toms's result, I argue that a similar statement is true for simple AI-algebras. This last statement is a work in progress.</p></div>

<p><b>Nicholas LaRacuente</b> (University of Chicago) - <a onclick="toggle_visibility('a12');">Modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities vs. quantum Zeno effect<img id="a12button" src="images/down.png" width="15px"></a></p><div class="abstract" id="a12"><p>Quantum Markov Semigroups (QMSs) model time evolution of open quantum systems under dissipative interactions with their environments. Modified logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities (MLSIs) lower bound exponential relative entropy decay rates to invariant subspaces. Recent developments have shown a tensor-stable version of MLSI known as complete MLSI (CMLSI) for all finite-dimensional QMSs having a form of detailed balance. In the absence of detailed balance, many questions have remained open. I show finite-dimensional counterexamples to universal (C)MLSI. Furthermore, I examine a surprising conflict between semigroup-induced decay and generalizations of the quantum Zeno effect: when dissipative time evolution co-occurs with Hamiltonian time evolution, the overall decay rate may depend inversely on that of the dissipative process. I prove upper and lower bounds on decay rates in these circumstances.</p></div>
<p><b>Boyu Li</b> (University of Waterloo) - <a onclick="toggle_visibility('a13');">Wold decomposition on self-similar graphs<img id="a13button" src="images/down.png" width="15px"></a></p><div class="abstract" id="a13"><p>A self-similar graph encodes the intertwining relations between a directed graph and a semigroup. We consider covariant representations of these self-similar graphs and derive their Wold decompositions. This generalize an earlier result on the Wold decomposition of Nica covariant representations of the odometer semigroups. We will also present several examples using atomic representations. This is a joint work with Dilian Yang.</p></div>

<p><b>Dolapo Oyetunbi</b> (University of Ottawa) - <a onclick="toggle_visibility('a17');"> On l-open C* algebras and semiprojectivity<img id="a17button" src="images/down.png" width="15px"></a></p><div class="abstract" id="a17"><p>Given two separable C* algebras B and D and an ideal I of D. We can equip the space of -homomorphism from B to D/I, Hom (B, D/I), with the point-norm topology. B is l-open (or l-closed) if for any separable C​ algebras D and Ideal I of D, the set of *-homomorphism from B to D/I, which lifts to *-homomorphism from B to D, is always open (or closed) in Hom (A, B/I). Bruce Blackadar showed that semiprojective C*-algebras are l-open and l-closed.  In this talk, we will characterize l-open C*-algebras and deduce that l-open C* algebras are l-closed as conjectured by Blackadar. Moreover, we will show that the notion of l-open and semiprojectivity coincide in the category of commutative unital C* algebras.</p></div>
<p><b>Michael Rosbotham</b> (Queen's University Belfast and Carleton University ) - <a onclick="toggle_visibility('a18');">Relative cohomology for operator modules<img id="a18button" src="images/down.png" width="15px"></a></p><div class="abstract" id="a18"><p>n joint work with Martin Mathieu (Queen's University Belfast), we study relative cohomological dimension for operator modules over operator algebras. We give an overview on results for two important classes of operator space modules. Although these classes appear quite different, we show that the conditions for having associated cohomological dimension equal to zero coincide. The main new and unifying tool is the use of exact structures on categories of operator modules.</p></div>
<p><b>Anamaria Savu</b> (University of Alberta) - <a onclick="toggle_visibility('a19');">Processes with zero-range interaction and integrability<img id="a19button" src="images/down.png" width="15px"></a></p><div class="abstract" id="a19"><p>Zero-range processes are interacting particle systems where particles hop between the lattice sites with rates that depend solely on the number of particles of the departure site. The behaviour on the long wavelength and time-scale of zero-range processes have been extensively studied, and asymptotic results such as hydrodynamic scaling limit, central limit theorem, or large deviations of the empirical distribution of particles have been established. A specific zero-range process on the 1-dimensional infinite lattice, the q-Boson system, was introduced by Sasamoto and Wadati. The q-Boson specifies that a single particle leaves a site at a rate equal to [n], the q-integer of the site occupancy n. Notably, the q-Boson was shown to be integrable in the sense that a class of eigenfunctions can be constructed for the Hamiltonian of the process. Also, several authors (Korhonen and Lee, 2013, Borodin, Corwin, Petrov, and Sasamoto 2014) showed that the transition probabilities can be computed exactly .  Later the q-Boson was generalized by Takeyama to a q-Block using the algebra structure generated by the multiplication and divided-difference operators of Lascoux and Schützenberger. The q-Block is totally asymmetric, exhibits zero-range interaction, and has the novel feature that any number of available particles can leave the site. We show that the system of Takeyama can be enhanced to allow the movement of particles to both left and right and remain integrable. Also, we discuss the attractiveness and propose that the hydrodynamic scaling limit of the system is a first-order quasilinear partial differential equation.</p></div>

<p><b>Camila Sehnem</b> (Victoria University of Wellington) - <a onclick="toggle_visibility('a21');">Nuclearity for partial crossed products by exact discrete groups<img id="a21button" src="images/down.png" width="15px"></a></p><div class="abstract" id="a21"><p>Important classes of C*-algebras can be described as partial crossed products. Although a partial action of a discrete group on a C*-algebra is in an appropriate sense always equivalent to a global action, the commutativity of the underlying C*-algebra may be lost under this correspondence. I will report on joint work with A. Buss and D. Ferraro, in which we generalise a result by Matsumura for ordinary actions by showing that the partial crossed product of a commutative C*-algebra by an exact discrete group is nuclear whenever the full and reduced partial crossed products coincide.</p></div>
<p><b>Paul  Skoufranis</b> (York University) - <a onclick="toggle_visibility('a22');">Non-commutative stochastic processes and bi-free probability<img id="a22button" src="images/down.png" width="15px"></a></p><div class="abstract" id="a22"><p>When Voiculescu introduced the notion of bi-free independence, he envisioned that the theory would model the transition between past and future states. As such, the objects under consideration were called “pairs of faces” after the Roman god of transitions Janus who is often depicted with two faces, one looking to the past and one to the future. In this talk, we will discuss how the transition operators for non-commutative stochastic processes can be modelled using technology from bi-free probability. Several important examples are recovered with this approach and new formulae are obtained for processes with free increments. The benefits of this approach are also discussed.</p></div>

For large approximating matrices, we observe that the eigenvalues roughly follow an underlying distribution. This phenomenon is similar to the classical observation on Wigner matrices. We prove that the moments of such matrices converge asymptotically as the size increases and equals to the integral of a combinatorially-defined function which counts certain paths on a finite grid.</p></div>
